# Advent of Code 2018 Solutions in Elixir

I am working through these in December 2019 but wanted to get more experience with Elixir to hopefully find a job doing Elixir full time!

If you are looking for an Elixir Software Engineer who has been building business software professionally for 20+ years in other languages hit me up https://linkedin.com/in/jtwebman

If you notice a better way of doing something please share with me as I m always learning!

## Run Solutions

```
iex -S mix
```

Then for each day you can run:

```
AOC.Day1.part1()
AOC.Day1.part2()
```

## Tests and Documention

I agree both should be written for any real code but I have left them out in this repo to just learn more Elixir as fast as possible.
